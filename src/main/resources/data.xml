		<Profile>Mary Senna is an excellent performer. She is very good working with less experienced people. They learn a lot from her and she has a good attitude toward the company and this rubs off onto the people working with her. She has about ten years experience. Senna does not like to work overtime when she is not convinced of the necessity. Her managers have often gone reactive and asked her to work overtime when it did not make sense to her. She has tended to take time off after working overtime, but if counseled and the reasons for overtime explained, then she works fine.</Profile>
